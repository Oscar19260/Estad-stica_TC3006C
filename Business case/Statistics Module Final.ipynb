    "- Design and run a multiple regression model to examine whether your selected factors and earnings per share deflated by price can explain/predict annual stock returns. You have to control for industry and firm size. To control for these variables you have to include them as extra independent variables in the model\n",
    "    - Your independent variables must be in the right scale so that you can compare the values of the variables among different firms of any size\n",
    "    - For each independent variable you have to check for outliers and do the corresponding adjustments to avoid unreliable results in your regression model\n",
    "    - You must check for possible multicollinearity problems. Briefly explain what is multicollinearity, run and interpret the corresponding test"
